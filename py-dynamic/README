h2. Dynamic Ice on Python

The current version of the Ice manual states:

> The dynamic invocation and dispatch interfaces allow you to write
> generic clients and servers that need not have compile-time knowledge
> of the Slice types used by an application. This makes it possible to
> create applications such as object browsers, protocol analyzers, or
> protocol bridges. In addition, the dynamic invocation and dispatch
> interfaces permit services such as IceStorm to be implemented without
> the need to unmarshal and remarshal every message, with considerable
> performance improvements.

So, it's clear why to use this aproach. But, again, it notes:

> The streaming interfaces are not defined in Slice, but are rather a
> collection of native classes provided by each language mapping. The
> streaming interfaces are currently supported in C++, Java, and
> .NET.

The streaming interfaces are needed to serialize data (the arguments in our invocations or the return value) to a buffer, which will be sent to the other endpoint. They are essential to use Dynamic Ice. It happens that Python does not have such classes (@InputStream@ nor @OutputStream@) :(. We will try to do our best without them.

h2. First, our non-needed interfaces

We will to build two examples: the first using Dynamic Invocation, and the second, with Dynamic Dispatching. Nothing forbids you to build a new one using both ;) To acomplish this, we need some simple interface. In the Dynamic Invocation example, the interface will be used on the servant part (in the object's implementation). When using Dynamic Dispatching, the client will use it instead. Let's define it. It is a _Hello World!_ example, so it will be very simple:

<pre>
module Example {
  interface Hello {
    bool say(string message);
  };
};
</pre>

h2. The standard way

In the source code, there are two programs that use this interface following the standard mechanism. Both need to know the module _Example_, and cast the correspondient proxy to the interface _Hello_. The server is called @standard-dispatching.py@ and the client is @standard-invocation.py@. You can try it now. First, launch the _server_:

<pre>
$ ./standard-dispatching.py
Use proxy: 'StandardDispatching -t:tcp -h 192.168.1.130 -p 1234'
</pre>

It tells you the proxy where is waiting events. As it is a standard example, I will not explain it. If you have any doubt about what is doing, just see the code! :) Now, launch the client (in other console), as follows:

<pre>
$ ./standard-invocation.py
USAGE: ./standard-invocation.py <proxy> <message>
$ ./standard-invocation.py 'StandardDispatching -t:tcp -h 192.168.1.130 -p 1234' 'Hello World!'
</pre>

As you can see, the client expect two arguments: a @proxy@ and a @message@. If you look at the server's console, you will find something like that:

<pre>
$ ./standard-dispatching.py
Use proxy: 'StandardDispatching -t:tcp -h 192.168.1.130 -p 1234'
say: Hello World!
</pre>

Ok, nothing special. Let's get more Dyanmic!

h2. The Dyanmic way: invocation

Alongside with the previous Python scripts, are two more programs. We will start with the Dynamic Invocation.

The client is almost the same. Only those things related to our @Example@ interface are changed. Thus, now there is no @loadSlice@, nor any casting of the given proxy. And... how then should I call to @say@ method? Well, with Dynamic Ice, your pal is the method @ice_invoke@. This method is defined on @ObjectPrx@. If it were to be defined on Slice, it would look like this:

<pre>
sequence<byte> ByteSeq;

bool ice_invoke(
    string operation,
    Ice::OperationMode mode,
    ByteSeq inParams,
    out ByteSeq outParams
);
</pre>

There, you should pass all the requiered information, and expect return params as well. Let's see each field:

* @string operation@: this is the name of the operation to call. In our example, this would be the string "say". If you want to "ping" an object, then should be "ice_ping". This is the easiest one :)

* @Ice::OperationMode mode@: this is the mode, as defined on the slice. It can be: _Normal_ or _Idempotent_ (_Nonmutating_ is deprecated). Use the constants defined on Ice: @Ice.OperationMode.Idempotent@ and @Ice.OperationMode.Normal@ (maybe, you just can pass 0 or 2, but I've not checked it out, and this is more clear).

* @ByteSeq inParams@: this is the hardest part. Here, @ice_invoke@ expects a ByteSeq (or a @buffer@, in Python lands). The problem is how to create such a buffer. We will discuss it later.

* @ByteSeq outParams@: the same could be said as for @inParams@. In Python, this will be a return value, alongside with the proper retval.

It will return a tuple, containing two values: return value (bool), which will be True if success and False on error; and @outParams@, a _buffer_ with returning data. In Python, the method will look like this:

<pre>
  ice_invoke(operation, mode, inParams) -> bool, outParams
</pre>

h3. Marshalling data

To use Dynamic Ice on Python, ZeroC gives us almost everything. The only lacking tool to acomplish it correctly are the marshalling and unmarshalling methods. These are the _stream interfaces_ mentioned above.

In the vast major of circumstances, there is no need for this. You just receive the invocation, makes whatever you need, and forward it to another object, which can handle it properly. This is the case, for example, of a router, or a traffic logger. For this, there is no need to know anything about the data transferred: for us this data is a 'blob'.

In this case (Dynamic Invocation as a pure client), we really know what the server object needs, but it is not specified on a interface. This is a very rare situation. In order to acomplish it, we must pay the bill. Here, we should know a lot about Ice Encoding to understand what we need. Otherwise, you will have ending with a @Ice::MarshallException@.

For this example, I've writen a simple marshaller. It is a very simple and rude implementation of what would be the InputStream for Python, but it works as expected. Only supports what was needed for this tutorial. I presume you wouldn't need it for real scenarios. Otherwise, you should build a good one, using TDD and every other tool you need.

h3. Invoke Ice

Ok, as far as this point, we haven't done anything. Time to code! This is the only interesting part:

<pre>
    ...
    operation = "say"
    mode = Ice.OperationMode.Normal
    inParams = OutputStream()
    inParams.writeString(args[2])

    ok, outParams = self.prx.ice_invoke(operation, mode, inParams)
    if ok:
        result = InputStream(outParams).readBool()
	assert result

    else:
        print "An error ocurred!"
</pre>

We build the operation name and mode without problems. Then, build an @OutputStream@ called @inParams@. This is _output_ in the sense of _marshalling_, which has methods to _write_ data. We pass the given string and call @ice_invoke@. If everything is ok, we read the method return value, a bool, which indicates whether the operation could be performed or not. If @ok@ is False, then there were some error, and I omit it.

As you can see, the only special things here are the marshaller and unmarshaller needed to send the arguments and read the return value of the remote method. If this is implemented inside another object which uses Dynamic Dispatching, these arguments are received directly, as we will see in the next section.

h2. The Dyanmic way: dispatching

The key here is the implementation of the _servant_. We have not an interface, but still need an object to whom inherit our servant, and a method to be called. This is provided by Ice, with Ice.Blobject. The slice is defined like this:

<pre>
sequence<byte> ByteSeq;

interface Blobject {
    bool ice_invoke(ByteSeq inParams, out ByteSeq outParams);
};
</pre>

As we will be using Python, the out param is return directly, after the return value of the operation. So, in Python, this method will be like:

<pre>
    def ice_invoke(self, inParams, current):
        ...
	return retval, outParams
</pre>

The name of the operation, the mode and some other information is delegated on the Context (here, accesible by the @current@ argument). You just need add whatever you need to do. If you need to unmarshall data, you'll have the same problem as above. Check the code for an ad-hoc implementation of this Stream Interfaces:

<pre>
    inParams = InputStream(bytes)
    message = inParams.readString()

    print "{0}: {1}".format(current.operation, message)

    out = OutputStream()
    out.writeBool(True)
    outParams = out.finished()

    return True, outParams
</pre>

Here, we know that in @inParams@ a string is encapsulated, so I use the InputStream to get it. To return from this method, there needs two values: a boolean (here, a True, indicating the local engine that everything is ok), and another boolean, the return value of the method @say@, in our interface. For this, I use OutputStream.

h3. Checked Casting

The implementation of @ice_invoke@ must handle every invocation to the object, specially those defined in @Ice.Object@ (everyone starting with @ice_@). When doing a _checked_cast_, Ice internally issues an @ice_isA()@ operation on the object. Thus, if you want to allow this type of casting, you need to respond correctly to this operation. The problem is that you haven't any interface (that's why you use Dynamic Ice, isn't it?). So, you will need to say 'yes' to every @ice_isA@ invocation, and be prepared to handle correctly every other invocation.

For simplicity's sake, in the examples, all castings are unchecked.

h2. Go on!

If you launch both programs, they will behave exactly the same as the _standard_ version, but using Dynamic Ice :D

On one console, launch the server:

<pre>
$ ./dynamic-dispatching.py
Use proxy: 'DynamicDispatching -t:tcp -h 192.168.1.130 -p 1234'
</pre>

On another console, launch the client:

<pre>
$ ./dynamic-invocation.py 'DynamicDispatching -t:tcp -h 192.168.1.130 -p 1234' 'Hello Dynamic World!'
</pre>

And you should get in the first console something like this:

<pre>
$ ./dynamic-dispatching.py
Use proxy: 'DynamicDispatching -t:tcp -h 192.168.1.130 -p 1234'
say: Hello Dynamic World!
</pre>

This brief tutorial presented what can be done using Dynamic Ice on Python: Invocation and Dispatching of synchronous calls. Nevertheless, there are more things you can do: AMI and AMD (asynchronous calls). This time, I left the joy of discovering it for yourself ;)
